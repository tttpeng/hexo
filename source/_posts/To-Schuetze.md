"Should this life sometime deceive you, don't be sad or mad at it..." LOL~ There are lots of  beautiful view along our roads. Perhaps parts of them once attracted you deeply, so you might enjoy yourself among them. However, don't lose your way when you left them, just be a brave Sagittarius and go on without any hesitation. The short-lived story only proved that they are not your destination. Please realize that you have to continue walking and having other wonderful experiences, and please remember there are also many other guys caring about you and pray for you. I am doing what a friend should do. The BM is particularly prepared for you. Let me wish you a merry Christmas, a happy new year, and a bright future.
